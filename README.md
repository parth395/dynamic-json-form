# Multi-Step Form

A dynamic multi-step form built using React that allows users to fill out multiple sections of a form, with field validation and smooth navigation between steps.

## Features

- **Multi-step Navigation**: Users can move between form steps using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **Dynamic Field Rendering**: The form fields are generated dynamically from a JSON-based configuration.
- **Form Validation**: The form validates required fields, ensuring that all required data is filled out before progressing to the next step or submitting the form.
- **Support for Multiple Input Types**: 
  - Text, Number, Textarea
  - Dropdowns
  - Radio Buttons
  - Checkboxes
  - Sliders
- **Customizable**: You can easily modify or add more steps and fields by updating the configuration.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: The JavaScript library used to build the UI.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the form UI and validation errors.

### Multi-Step Form Configuration

The form is driven by a `formData` object, passed as a prop to the `MultiStepForm` component. Here’s an example configuration:

```javascript
const formData = {
  title: "User Registration",
  description: "Please fill out the details below to complete your registration.",
  groups: [
    {
      title: "Personal Information",
      fields: [
        { name: "firstName", label: "First Name", type: "text", required: true },
        { name: "lastName", label: "Last Name", type: "text", required: true },
        { name: "age", label: "Age", type: "number", required: true },
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Preferences",
      fields: [
        {
          name: "color",
          label: "Favorite Color",
          type: "dropdown",
          options: ["Red", "Green", "Blue"],
          required: true,
        },
        {
          name: "newsletter",
          label: "Subscribe to Newsletter",
          type: "checkbox",
          options: [
            { value: "yes", label: "Yes" },
          ],
          required: false,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

### Validation

Fields that have the `required: true` attribute will be validated before allowing the user to navigate to the next step or submit the form. If a required field is left empty, an error message will appear and the field will be highlighted.

### Styling

The form uses basic custom CSS for layout and validation. You can update the styles in the `MultiStepForm.css` file to match your design preferences.

### Running Tests

Currently, no tests are included in the project. You can add tests using frameworks like **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration testing.

## Future Enhancements

- **Form Data Persistence**: Saving form data in localStorage or a backend server.
- **Advanced Validation**: Adding more complex validation patterns (e.g., email format, password strength).
- **Custom Field Types**: Extending the form to include custom field types like file uploads or date pickers.
